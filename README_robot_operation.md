## üì° Sensor Operation

### Ultrasonic & IR Sensors

- Enable/Disable via software commands.
- Retrieve readings from 8 sensor banks.
- Ultrasonic blind spot (0‚Äì6 inch) covered using IR sensors.

### Inertial Measurement Unit

- Access raw 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data via serial commands.

## üíª Command Format

Commands use the format:

```
'N' 'E' 'X' <Command> <Sub-command/Data> <Checksum>
```

Example:
```bash
HEX: 4E 45 58 70 01 62 42
```
Where `42` is checksum (1's complement + 1).
